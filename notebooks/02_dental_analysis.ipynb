    " # HCF Dental Centre Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " This notebook analyses patterns in dental visits to help increase member utilisation of HCF-owned dental centres across Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Key Insights from Analysis:\n",
    " - Average member age: 44 years (range: 18-88)\n",
    " - Member concentration: NSW (30.1%), VIC (25%)\n",
    " - Average treatment cost: $256.16\n",
    " - Visit frequency: 0.51 visits/year\n",
    " - Satisfaction score: 8.03/10\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Analysis Goals\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Geographic Analysis**\n",
    "    - Where are our members?\n",
    "    - Where are our centres?\n",
    "    - Are there coverage gaps?\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Visit Patterns**\n",
    "    - When do members visit?\n",
    "    - What treatments are popular?\n",
    "    - How does weather affect visits?\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Member Segmentation**\n",
    "    - Who are our members?\n",
    "    - What are their preferences?\n",
    "    - How can we serve them better?\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. **Recommendations**\n",
    "    - How to increase utilisation?\n",
    "    - Where to open new centres?\n",
